# PredPump - The infinite market for DEGENS

PredPump is an open prediction market that allows everyone to create and vote on bets, ensuring a free and decentralized prediction market. Developed at Consensus HK
## ‼️ Problem Statement

Prediction markets are powerful, but they can feel out of reach for most people. Here's why:

- **Too Many Restrictions:** Platforms like Polymarket limit users to creating markets only on topics supported by specific oracles (like UMA). If your idea doesn't fit within their framework, you're out of luck.
- **Complicated Resolutions:** Market outcomes can be slow and complex to resolve, creating frustration and uncertainty for users.

Prediction markets often fail to address real-world needs due to unnecessary restrictions. Here’s an example:

- **No Freedom to Create Markets:** Imagine the recent U.S. election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. You want to create a market to predict the winner, but platforms like Polymarket won’t allow it because the winning result isn’t readily available in their oracle data. This limitation prevents users from engaging in meaningful predictions on relevant, real-world events.
